# Things to add to this

Done
1. Create a conditional loop that only outputs the file if the detect-crop does not match "0:0:0:0"
2. Properly set up this GitHub project
3. Create some code that recognises differences between the HandBrakeCLI and mplayer $crop-return values.

ToDo
4. Give the user a choice of which return to accept and write that out to the crop file.
